# DumbScreen-Trojan
Thank God SmartScreen protected my computer. It will be enough if I just do not open the file. Or will it not happen?

This trojan is a clone of Windows Defender's SmartScreen alert. If you dare to close the warning or ignore the warning and not open the file. Your device will NOT start up again. However, if you try to run it anyway, nothing will happen to your computer.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR DEVICE! ONLY TRY IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE.
